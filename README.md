## Purpose Of This Repository
To show there are multiple ways to a same Requirements with different run time so that one can understand the difference between various logic.

## Tech Stack

**Software:** VS Code , Python 3

**Questions from Sites(Logics too):**
- Geeks For Geeks
- Guvi
- Udemy
- Hacker Rank

## Feedback

If you have any feedback, please mail me at anant.arun92@gmail.com

## FAQ
#### 1) All programs logic are done by me?
No, only few of them. Others have been taken from different sites with best runtime

#### 2) Time Taken by the program are in which unit?
They are in seconds.

#### 3) How to Contact me?
Check Feedback Panel.

#### 4) Can you use codes?
Yeah, you surely can for practice but cannot show it your own , you have to mention my name and other sites as per license.
