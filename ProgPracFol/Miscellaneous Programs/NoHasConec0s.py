Check whether a number has consecutive 0â€™s in the given base or not

Given a decimal number N, the task is to check if a number has consecutive zeroes or not after converting the number to its K-based notation.

Examples: 

Input: N = 4, K = 2 
Output: No 
4 in base 2 is 100, As there are consecutive 2 thus the answer is No.

Input: N = 15, K = 8 
Output: Yes 
15 in base 8 is 17, As there are no consecutive 0 so the answer is Yes.
