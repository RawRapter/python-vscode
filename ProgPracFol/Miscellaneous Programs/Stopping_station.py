GFG
Program for Number of stopping station problem

There are 12 intermediate stations between two places A and B.
Find the number of ways in which a train can be made to stop at 4 
of these intermediate stations so that no two stopping stations are consecutive?

Examples â€“
Input  : n = 12, s = 4
Output : 126

Input  : n = 16, s = 5
Output : 792
